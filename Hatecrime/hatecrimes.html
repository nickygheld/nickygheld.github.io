      <p>One would think that after a history of hate, our nation would’’ve learn a thing or two about identifying it. Our many strides in social progress would suggest that, as a nation, we could recognize hate for what it is, a horrible, no good, very bad thing. However, the recent report on hate crimes issued by the Federal Bureau of Justice Statistics (the agency responsible for analyzing the heaps of data reported by the FBI) suggests otherwise.</p>

      <p>By looking at this graph tracking hate crimes over the last 30 years, one would think that we were on the right track  - until a spike during the Trump administration, culminating with a climax during the final year of his reign. At first glance, all the reported data seems to add up. But, look at the reported victim count by state gathered from the same dataset.</p>

      <p>The distortion in hate crime statistics is due to a number of factors, including under-reporting by many local law enforcement agencies.  Justice Department officials note that  “law enforcement agency participation in submitting all crime statistics, including hate crimes, fell significantly from 2020 to 2021,” blaming “the shift to NIBRS-only data collection,” a universal reporting system that has existed for years <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/12/doj-hate-crime-reporting-down-00073532">(Politico)</a></p>
		
	  <p>You can imagine the frustration of anti-hate crime advocacy groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Law Poverty Center when the Justice Department released a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/us/politics/fbi-hate-crimes.html">statement</a> questioning the accuracy of this year’s FBI report.</p>


      <p> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lKbka1UAAAAJ&hl=en">Megan Squires</a> , a professor of computer science at Elon and fellow at the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> and the <a href="https://www.adl.org/">Anti Defamation League</a>, described the report as 
	  “full of problems and holes and is incomplete […] from a statistics point of view it’s a nightmare.” </p>

		<p>She explained that combating hate requires a multifaceted approach because it is very fluid; this battle does not start with data that the FBI reports.</p>  
		 
		<p>The NIBRS system stands for National Incident-Based Reporting System.  NIBRS has been the universal standard for reporting hate crimes for years, but it has always been up to individual federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to participate in reporting into the system.</p>
		 
		<p>The Justice Department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/us/politics/fbi-hate-crimes.html">stated</a>, “Several of the nation’s largest law enforcement agencies, as well as some states, did not make the transition” to the system in time to meet the reporting deadline.</p>
		  
		<p>According to the Bureau of Justice 2010-2019 report, of the 15,588 law enforcement agencies that “participated” in the Hate Crime Statistics Program in 2019, only 2,172 agencies actually submitted an incident report. The problem is a lack of agency within the various law enforcement  agencies.</p>
		  
		<p> “Do you think the reported numbers are accurate?
		Dr. Squires: No and we can tell that they never have been.” </p>

        <p><a href="https://tacklinghate.org/trainingmodule/hate-crime-reporting-barriers-why-victims-of-hate-related-incidents-are-reluctant-to-report2/">Research</a> has shown the very act of reporting a hate crime by victims is a voluntary endeavor.  And victims do not always report hate crimes because they are dealing with a myriad of internal factors such as internalization, cultural norms, lack of information on the reporting process, and not even knowing they’ve been involved in a hate crime in the first place. There are external factors as well, such as language barriers, the fear of social consequences, or the inaccessibility to transportation or technology.</p>
		  
        <p>On top of this, many victims do not trust the law enforcement agencies supposed to protect them.  Historically, there have been consequences for simply reporting a hate crime, and this history is intimidating. It wasn’t even <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mississippi-burning-murders-case-files-public-james-chaney-andrew-goodman-michael-schwerner/">60</a> years ago that people were getting killed for it. Victims often fear being outed or getting in trouble, and they have concerns about affecting relationships with law enforcement, the pointlessness of reporting, not being taken seriously, or uninformed responses.</p>
		  
        <p>Overcoming fear of law enforcement and other internal struggles to report a hate crime is difficult, especially if the victim feels the report will not be taken seriously.  Having your report disregarded can feel like a slap in the face.</p>
		  
        <p>Due to voluntary reporting methods used by law enforcement agencies alongside social implications or repercussions, many hate crimes go unreported. This underreporting of hate crimes allows the culture of hate and its effects to thrive.</p>
